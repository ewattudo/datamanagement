This data includes preliminary results of a digital advertising campaign targeting southern New Jersey with the goal of increasing awareness of graduate school programs in this important region. I needed to process this data to make strategic decisions about this campaign as it enters its final month. I requested and received this data in a CSV format.\n",

        "I chose the final dataset because it sparked my interest both academically and professionally. Academically, I used this dataset previously in a GIS class, but I only used the geometry fields. However, I recalled that it also contained population data and economic indices. I am interested in manipulating this data more, but doing so did not align with my research question in that class. Professionally, I am interested in learning more about the region of the world where we receive so many students—Asia broadly, and South Asia in particular. I don't know much about this geographic region, and the SHP file allows me to learn about the physical locations and quantitative data simultaneously."

I was astonished that when the killing occurred in 2014, the majority-Black district did not have a single Black person in municipal leadership. This seemed odd to me, but upon further review, I noticed that states with the highest African American populations often did not have African Americans elected statewide. Furthermore, many of these states were in the southern United States—an area known to be politically conservative. This was interesting to me, and this data read helps me examine this data in greater detail."
